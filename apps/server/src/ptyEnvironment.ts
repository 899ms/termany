/**
 * Build the environment inherited by an interactive PTY.
 *
 * Packaged macOS apps launched from Finder commonly have no LANG/LC_CTYPE.
 * zsh then falls back to a single-byte locale and renders UTF-8 input from an
 * IME as replacement/control characters (for example `�<0086>`) even though
 * the browser-side composition itself completed correctly.
 *
 * Only the character classification locale is repaired. Other locale
 * categories keep the user's values, and an existing UTF-8 locale is left
 * untouched.
 *
 * `paneId` publishes the pane's session id as `TERMANY_PANE_ID`, so a program
 * running inside the pane can tell which pane it is in. Terminals commonly
 * expose such an identifier (`ITERM_SESSION_ID`, `WEZTERM_PANE`, `TMUX_PANE`),
 * and tools that automate a specific pane need it: without one they have to
 * guess from the working directory or scrape the scrollback, both of which
 * pick the wrong pane when several sessions share a directory.
